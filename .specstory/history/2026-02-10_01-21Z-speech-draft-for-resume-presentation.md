The user wants me to write a speech script for their resume based on the content in index.html. They want it to be close to spoken language (口语化). Let me first read the index.html file to understand the resume content.

I've read the full resume. Now I need to write a speech script that:
1. Is based on this resume content
2. Is close to spoken language (口语化) - so it should sound natural when spoken, not like reading a document
3. Covers the key points: who he is, value proposition, core strengths, project highlights, skills, why choose him

I'll write it in Chinese as per user rules. The speech should flow naturally, use colloquial expressions, maybe some filler words that make it sound like talking, and structure it so it can be delivered in 3-5 minutes (typical self-intro length).
